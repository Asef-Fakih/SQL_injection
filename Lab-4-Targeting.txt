SQli - Product Category filter

End Goal: Determine the number of columns returned by the query

backgrounf (Union):
- The number and the order of the columns must be the same on all queries
- The data types must be compatible

SQLi attack: (way 1)
We want to find out the number of columns ?

Select ? from table1 Union Select NULL
if error -> we know the column number is not 1
No error we figured out the column number

Select ? from table1 Union Select NULL, NULL
if error -> we know the column number is more than 2
no error we figured out the column number

Determine the data type of the columns
Select ? from table1 Union Select NULL, 'a'
if error -> we know the column number is not 2
No error we figured out the column number is 2 and the second column is string
